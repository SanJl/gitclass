						<h2>HOW WE MET</h2>
						<p>
							In 2010 the two were both wild and running free around San Francisco’s Marina District, as most singles do. Bradley was quite the bachelor- planning weekend getaways with friends, float trips, and taking last minute trips to Ibiza, Cabo, wherever the wind blew. Sarah was quite the bachelorette, wining and dining around San Francisco, on a strict agenda which included over-extending herself, saying yes to every social engagement that came her way.  After a mutual friend of the two suggested they would make a cute couple, a date was on the books and they began to discover just how compatible they were. In no time, they also discovered they were inseparable and very in love. The rest is history- they’ve shared some amazing adventures around the world, each other's toothbrushes, and now they’re ready to share the rest of their lives together, too.

					<h2>THE ENGAGEMENT</h2>
					<p>Down in San Diego for a weekend to visit Bradley’s mom, the pair decided to spend the beautiful morning at Balboa Park. After returning to their hotel, Bradley asked Sarah to run up to their room for a bottle of wine that had been chilling. Bradley said he was going to ask concierge for a “wine opener?and that he’d meet her in the courtyard. As Sarah opened the door to the room, she “freaked out? thinking she was in the wrong room. It was decorated with bouquets of her favorite flowers, decadent treats and champagne. Rose petals on the floor led her to the open balcony, and as she walked out she saw Bradley waiting for her down below, with a huge grin on his face. And like out of a fairy tale, Romeo asked Juliet to be his wife. She giggled, and said yes. Bradley had it all captured by a hidden, sniper-style photographer.</p>
